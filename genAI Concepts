Deep Learning is subset of ML
it has ANN- neural networks

medical image classification. behavior data analysis, Financial Prediction

GenAI is subset of Deep Learning

AI->ML->DL->GenAI

GenAI- genrates new content like images or videos
-> use cases- text generation, text summarization, text extraction, create music or videos

Large language models (LLM)
- trained on large corpus of data
- predicts the probability of the next word

#Transformer Architecture

Inner workings of LLMs

Decoder:

The students opened their - _______, pick up the highest probable word

Gen AI Limitations:

1) Hallucinations:- trained on fabricated content with no basis on its training data.
2) Inaccuracy- based on outdated data
3) Interpretabiliry: challenging to understand how a decision was made.
4) Nondeterminism
5) Verbose/Chatty- over generate content

Foundational Model Types
- Text to Text
- Text to embeddings
- Multimodal (image + text)
