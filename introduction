introduction to ML

AI- is a technique that allows computers to mimic human intelligence using logic.

earlier- 

if customer purchase shoes
--show them socks.

With ML- we train large amount of data
Labelled (has annoted features) or Unlabelled data (lacks annotation), so Model can then predict futire behavio / Predictions.

DATA - Recognize Patterns - Make Predictions

Features- i/p variables

Weights- representssignificance of each feature

Labels- thing we are trying yo predict.

use cases:

personalization, recommendation systems, predictive maintainance, demand forecasting etc

ML Types
- Supervised learning- labeled data (ex- rxns is frud or not a fraud), classification, regression (stock or house price)
- Unseupervised Learning- Unlabeled data., eg- clustering- frquent shoppers, bargain hunters, occasional visitors.- Anomaly Detection- to identify eare items, events or observations.
- Reinforcement Learning- self driving cars
